# Deep Learning Task 3 - Regularization and Optimization

Continuation to [DL_T2](https://github.com/davidrojas0791/DL_T2), this task has the objective of introducing different regularization and optimization methods for the models previously built. 

Concepts explored:
- Weight Decay
- Dropout
- Xavier initialization
- He initialization
- Gradient Descent with momentum
- RMSProp
- Adam
